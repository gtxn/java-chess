# Welcome to java-chess!

## Intro

This is my first java project after learning some java basics through this great 12 hour [youtube introduction to Java](https://youtu.be/xk4_1vDrzzo) :) I used Java Swing and also chess piece images from [Pychess](https://github.com/pychess/pychess/tree/master/pieces/cardinal).

## Functionality

There is support for the basic mechanics in chess, like castling and pawns changing when it reaches the end.

HOWEVER there is no checking for checkmates yet... The game ends when the king is captured. Undo-ing moves are also not possible. Right now it's a barebones chess engine, but I'll add more cool upgrades if I have the time :D
